        <p>Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. (They all climb into the car. And Doc backs up into the street.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>
